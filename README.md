# Property-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
This project aims to predict property prices using various machine learning algorithms. It involves handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and applying different regression techniques to determine the best-performing model.

📝 Dataset & Preprocessing
Missing values were handled appropriately.
Categorical variables were processed using One-Hot Encoding (OHE) and Label Encoding.
Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Implemented
